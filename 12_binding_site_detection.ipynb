    "The main objective of a pharmaceutical research is to find a new drug inorder to cure a specific disease. Structure-based approaches in drug design develop drugs with respect to a target protein which is associated with the disease under investigation. However, in order to develop such a drug it is crucial to know where the drug is supposed to bind in the protein and therefore inhibit or activate the protein. Not always such a small molecule binding site is known. Therefore it is important to have tools for binding site detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binding site detection has a special mention in the process of drug development. Binding sites are defined as a **hollow 3 dimensional space** on the surface of a protein molecule, which serves as the region for **ligand**, **peptide**, or **protein** binding. There are various factors which influence whether such a region is suitable binding site.\n",

    "   \n",
    "* **Grid-free approaches**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: Docking\n",
    "    * Docking process is similar to \"lock and key\" model in which the **target protein resembles** the **lock** and **ligand** to the **key**\n",
    "    * In this method, a scoring function is incorporated to evaluate the fragments that are placed at a position on the protein surface.\n",
    "    * Scoring functions are physics based, which uses Molecular Mechanics force fields, which primarily estimates the amount of affinity between the binding ligand and the protein.\n",
    "    * The scoring functions calculates the feasibilty of whether the ligand could be docked to the particular protein\n",

Pocket volume and surface are calculated by counting the **grid points** constituting the pocket volume or its surface and multiplying this number with the grid box volume or surface, respectively.

It also deals with the kinase domains and also the inhibitors which can interact with them. Kinases share a similar conserved regions, which serves as a challenge for small molecules that can selectively bind to a specific kinase. \n",

    "KLIFS enables us to do systematic comparison and analysis of chemical features of all available kinases in the process of ligand binding. The classification helps us of an all-encompassing binding site of 85 residues. It is possible to compare the **interaction patterns** of **kinase-inhibitors** to each other to, for example, identify crucial interactions determining kinase-inhibitor selectivity. Therefore this could be an ideal method used for the validation of the obtained binding site. "

    "#### Introduction to the used methods\n",
    " \n",
    " There are 3 automatic methods for the pocket and the druggability predictions. They include,\n",
    " * Sitemap (2009)\n",
    " * Fpocket (2009/2010)\n",
    " * DogSiteScorer (2010)\n",
    " \n",
    " All 3 algorithms predict pockets solely based on the **atomic co-ordinates** of the protein.\n",
    " \n",
    " * **SiteMap** uses **van der Waals (VdW) energies** and a **buriedness value** calculated on a grid to predict pockets on the protein surface.\n",
    " * **Fpocket** investigates **α spheres** for active site predictions.\n",
    " * In **DoGsiteScorer** , pockets and subpockets are predicted with DoGSite using a Difference of **Gaussian filter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***The shape (and the molecular orientation) of the region\n",
    "\n",
    " * (London dispersion forces)\n",
    "    * (Covalent interaction)\n",

    "* The radii is scaled down to ensure that they don't clash with the surrounding atom of a protein.\n",
    "    * Small virtual probes are used to cover and coat the protein surface.  Number of probes surrounding each atom is calculated. The spaces on the outer surfaces are filled and the potential binding site centers are selected.\n",

    "#### Fpocket \n",

    "Fpocket stands for \"Finding Pocket\". The pocket detection package based on Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres. **Fpocket** investigates **α spheres** for active site predictions. Fpocket algorithm consists of three major steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <i>Step 1:</i> The whole ensemble of alpha spheres is determined from the protein structure. Fpocket returns a   pre-filtered collection of spheres.\n",
    "* <i>Step 2:</i> Identifying the clusters of spheres close together, to identify pockets, and to remove clusters of poor interest.\n",
    "* <i>Step 3:</i> This finally calculates properties from the atoms of the pocket, in order to score each pocket.\n",
