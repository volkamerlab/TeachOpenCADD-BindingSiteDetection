The classification helps us of an all-encompassing binding site of **85 residues**. It is possible to compare the **interaction patterns** of **kinase-inhibitors** to each other to, for example, identify crucial interactions determining kinase-inhibitor selectivity. KLIFS API could return the binding pocket of a specific kinase protein. This could therefore be used as an ideal method to compare the binding site with regard to DogSiteScorer for **EGFR kinase** protein. "
