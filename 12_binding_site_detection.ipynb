    "\n",
    "The main objective of a pharmaceutical research is to find a new drug inorder to cure a specific disease. Structure-based approaches in drug design develop drugs with respect to a target protein which is associated with the disease under investigation. However, in order to develop such a drug it is crucial to know where the drug is supposed to bind in the protein and therefore inhibit or activate the protein. Not always such a small molecule binding site is known. Therefore it is important to have tools for binding site detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binding site detection has a special mention in the process of drug development. Binding sites are defined as a **hollow 3 dimensional space** on the surface of a protein molecule, which serves as the region for **ligand**, **peptide**, or **protein** binding. There are various factors which influence whether such a region is suitable binding site.\n",

Pocket volume and surface are calculated by counting the **grid points** constituting the pocket volume or its surface and multiplying this number with the grid box volume or surface, respectively.

Kinases share a similar conserved regions, which serves as a challenge for small molecules that can selectively bind to a specific kinase. \n",

The classification helps us of an all-encompassing binding site of 85 residues. It is possible to compare the **interaction patterns** of **kinase-inhibitors** to each other to, for example, identify crucial interactions determining kinase-inhibitor selectivity. Therefore this could be an ideal method used for the validation of the obtained binding site. "

    " There are 3 automatic methods for the pocket and the druggability predictions. They include,\n",

    " * Fpocket (2009/2010)\n",
    " * DogSiteScorer (2010)\n",
    " \n",
    " All 3 algorithms predict pockets solely based on the **atomic co-ordinates** of the protein.\n",
    " \n",
    " * **SiteMap** uses **van der Waals (VdW) energies** and a **buriedness value** calculated on a grid to predict pockets on the protein surface.\n",
    " * **Fpocket** investigates **α spheres** for active site predictions.\n",
    " * In **DoGsiteScorer** , pockets and subpockets are predicted with DoGSite using a Difference of **Gaussian filter**.\n",

    "* <i>Step 1:</i> The whole ensemble of alpha spheres is determined from the protein structure. Fpocket returns a   pre-filtered collection of spheres.\n",
    "* <i>Step 2:</i> Identifying the clusters of spheres close together, to identify pockets, and to remove clusters of poor interest.\n",
    "* <i>Step 3:</i> This finally calculates properties from the atoms of the pocket, in order to score each pocket.\n",
