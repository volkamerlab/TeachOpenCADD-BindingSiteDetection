    "### Introduction to pocket detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of a pharmaceutical research is to find a new drug inorder to cure a specific disease. Structure-based approaches in drug design, develop drugs with respect to a target protein which is associated with the disease under investigation. However, in order to develop such a drug it is crucial to know where the drug is supposed to bind in the protein and therefore inhibit or activate the protein. Not always such a small molecule binding site is known and therefore it is important to have tools for binding site detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pocket detection has a special mention in the process of drug prediction. Pockets are a **hollow 3 dimensional space** on the surface of a protein molecule, which serves as the region for **ligand**, **peptide**, or **protein** binding. There are various factors which determine the presence of pocket in 3 dimensional space of a protein:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The shape of the binding region\n",
    "* The possible interactions in a region such as\n",
    "    * Van der Waals forces\n",
    "    * Hydrogen bond interaction\n",
    "    * Hydrophobic forces\n",
    "    * Electrostatic interactions\n",
    "    * π-π interactions\n",
    "   \n",
    "Sometimes ligand information is available (protein-ligand-complex), in that case usually the ligand-surrounding protein region is defined as pocket (e.g. using a 6 A radius).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pocket detection approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "When the presence and the details of the ligand is known, then the ligand radius can be used to detect the pocket. When it is absent, then the detection tools can be used in the process of pocket detection. This comprises of 2 standard approaches. They include,\n",
    "* Geometry-based approach\n",
    "* Energy-based approach \n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometry-based approach:** This method analyzes the shape of a molecular surface to locate cavities. It is based upon the 3D spatial arrangement of the atoms in space. They are broadly divided into two namely Grid-Based and Grid-free approaches.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/img2.png\" class=\"center\" align=\"right\" width=\"350\"> \n",
    "* Grid-based approach:\n",
    "    * POCKET and LIGSITE are the common algorithms for the grid based methods.\n",
    "    * A cartesian grid is used to embed a protein with a usual spacing between 0.4 Å and 2.0 Å\n",
    "    * *This is assigned based upon the Van der Waal's radii* surrounding an atom of a protein.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "* Grid-free approach:\n",
    "    * SURFNET is a common algorithm for the grid-free methods.\n",
    "    * Places spheres on the protein surface. \n",
    "    * In SURFNET, probe spheres are placed midway between the pairs of atoms on the protein. Incase a probe overlaps any nearby atom, its radius is reduced until no overlap occurs. The resulting probes defines the pocket and the cavities. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Energy-based approach:** Interaction of a molecular fragment with protein is recorded. Favourable energitic responses are assigned to pockerts. DrugSite is the commonly used energy based algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Grid-based approach: \n",
    "    * DrugSite is a grid-based approach under the class of Energy based algorithms.\n",
    "    * This method uses carbon probes placed on each grid point, and vdW energies between the probes within adistance of 8 Å are calculated. Mean energy and SD are calculated for these grid points. \n",
    "    * Grid points with unfavourable energies are removed. Grid points fulfilling these cut-off are merged to pockets.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* Grid-free approach: \n",
    "    * Docking serves as an important method in the Energy-based grid-free approach.\n",
    "    * In this method, a scoring function is incorporated to evaluate the fragments that are placed at a position on the protein surface.\n",

    "#### DogSiteScorer \n",
    "\n",
    "Several geometric and physico-chemical properties are automatically calculated for the predicted pockets and subpockets. In **DogSiteScorer** , pockets and subpockets are predicted with DoGSite using a Difference of **Gaussian filter**. DogSiteScorer falls under the category of the grid based approaches.Pocket volume and surface are calculated by counting the **grid points** constituting the pocket volume or its surface and multiplying this number with the grid box volume or surface, respectively. A **breadth-first search** is used for pocket depth computation, starting from the solvent exposed pocket parts toward the most deeply buried regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Algorithm steps:\n",
    "   * Potential pockets on the protein surface is predicted. This is based upon **Protein heavy atom co-ordinates**<img src=\"images/img1.png\" class=\"center\" align=\"right\" width=\"260\"> \n",
    "   * The chosen protein is spanned around with a grid of co-ordinates.\n",
    "   * Each of the **grid points** are **labelled**.\n",
    "   * Difference of **Gaussian filter** is applied across the grid.\n",
    "   * This operation helps to find the position on a protein surface where the location of a **sphere-like object** is favorable.\n",
    "   * The last step is neighbouring subpockets are merged to the pockets.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* Druggability score:\n",
    "    * Druggability technique is based on Machine learning technique - Subject Vector Machine (SVM).\n",
    "    * **Discriminative Analysis** - Best suited to seperate druggable from undruggable.\n",
    "    * The model has been trained and tested on both the redundant and non-redundant version of the druggable dataset\n",
    "    * This model showed a mean accuracy of 90%.\n",
    "    * The druggabilty score lies between 0 and 1. The higher the score the better the chance that the pocket is druggable.\n",

    " <img src=\"images/img4.png\" class=\"center\" align=\"right\" width=\"220\">    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fpocket \n",
    "\n",
    "Fpocket stands for \"Finding Pocket\". The pocket detection package based on Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres. **Fpocket** investigates **α spheres** for active site predictions. Fpocket algorithm consists of three major steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <i>Step 1:</i> The whole ensemble of alpha spheres is determined from the protein structure. Fpocket returns a   pre-filtered collection of spheres.\n",
    "* <i>Step 2:</i> Identifying the clusters of spheres close together, to identify pockets, and to remove clusters of poor interest.\n",
    "* <i>Step 3:</i> calculates properties from the atoms of the pocket, in order to score each pocket.\n",

    "### Validation methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ligand-based detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes ligand information is available (protein-ligand-complex), in that case usually the ligand-surrounding protein region is defined as pocket (e.g. using a 6 A radius).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a bound ligand is known for a structure, it can be used for binding-site annotation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### KLIFS pocket definitons\n",
    "\n",
    "KLIFS stands for **Kinase-Ligand Interaction Fingerprints and structures database**. It is a structural repository of over 2900 human and mouse kinase enzymes and their catalytic activity. It also deals with the kinase domains and also the inhibitors which can interact with them. Kinases share a similar conserved regions, which serves as a challenge for small molecules that can selectively bind to a specific kinase. \n",
    "\n",
    "KLIFS enables us to do systematic comparison and analysis of chemical features of all available kinases in the process of ligand binding. The classification helps us of an all-encompassing binding site of 85 residues. It is possible to compare the **interaction patterns** of **kinase-inhibitors** to each other to, for example, identify crucial interactions determining kinase-inhibitor selectivity. Therefore this method could be used for the validation of the obtained binding site. "
